之前的 Profile 中有一处错误导致 Host 更改失败，已修复。

后门生成过程是根据 Profile 更改源码编译生成，所以会将 HttpReverseShell、HttpReverseLoader 中的关键源码复制一份改名为 Original 后缀用于最后还原。
如果你在后门生成过程中出现错误或主动关闭了窗口导致 Original 没有还原，请手动还原。

There was a bug in the previous Profile that caused Host changes to fail. This has been fixed.

The backdoor generation process is based on changing the source code of Profile, so a copy of the key source code in HttpReverseShell and HttpReverseLoader will be copied and renamed with the Original suffix for final restoration.
If you make an error during the backdoor generation process or actively close the window and the Original is not restored, please restore it manually.
